The Companyâ€™s strategy is to make counter-cyclical investments in ships bought at prices discounted to new building parity, particularly tankers and bulkers, as well as projects with long-term secured cashflow, low residual risk, and solid returns on equity. The Companyâ€™s business is investments in shipping. During 2020 when the Company owned a fleet of three VLCC tankers management had organized and managed the entity as one business segment based upon the service provided. During 2020 all three vessels operated in the spot market, with one vessel performing on a six month time charter contract. During 2021 the Company has not had any operating assets."],
